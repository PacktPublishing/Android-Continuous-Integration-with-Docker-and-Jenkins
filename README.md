# Android-Continuous-Integration-with-Docker-and-Jenkins
This is the code repository for [Android Continuous Integration with Docker and Jenkins [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/android-continuous-integration-docker-and-jenkins-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
As an Android developer, you feel a strong need for a hassle-free CI environment; moreover, you need a cloneable environment, especially for your UI tests, which need to be run on an Android “device". This course will show you how to create a fully functional CI using container technology; it lists all the problems you'll encounter and provides you with the corresponding solutions and detailed explanations. Later it will tell you how to setup scalable Jenkins nodes which enables parallel building, leaving you with no rework and no headaches at all. What if you have different hardware—maybe Linux machines or Mac computers? It works everywhere. You want your CI fast, stable, and lightweight, and preferably a free solution? No problem, you’ll be able to achieve your dream CI with Docker and scale it to all your systems by the end of this course.
